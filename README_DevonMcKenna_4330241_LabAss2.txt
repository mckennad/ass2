CS3130 - Lab Ass 2

To Run:     python3 MAIN.py
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ass 2 asks for a text file, then reads that file and grabs particular data from it.

1:  Separates individual words
2:  Counts the number of occurences for each distinct word
3:  Prints data in a specified format
4:  Creates a crude histogram based on the gathered data


The length of words is capped at a specified amount (20) and any words larger than that value are sliced (excess is ignored).
The code handles basic exceptions.
